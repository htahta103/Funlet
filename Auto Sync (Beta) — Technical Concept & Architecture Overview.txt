Funlet Auto Sync — Complete Product & Execution Specification (Updated)
Overview
Auto Sync is a background coordination process that helps an organizer collect availability responses from a group and decide whether to send calendar invites or stop scheduling. Auto Sync’s role is to collect responses and present state — the organizer always decides what to do next.
Auto Sync is designed to:
Run in the background


Be resumable


Support multiple concurrent Auto Syncs


Minimize friction for both organizers and invitees


Operate entirely via SMS for invitees


Auto Sync is not responsible for making final decisions. It gathers signal and pauses for organizer direction.

Core Principles (Locked)
Auto Sync gathers responses, then pauses.


Auto Sync never auto-decides outcomes.


The organizer always chooses whether to:


Send invites


Send another reminder


Stop Auto Sync


Auto Sync supports multiple concurrent runs per organizer.


Organizer-facing times use the organizer’s time zone.


Invitee SMS always includes an explicit time zone.


System messages are structured, consistent, and limited in count.


No organizer-written messages in Auto Sync v1.


Calendar access is optional; Auto Sync fully supports no-calendar mode.

Phase 1: Auto Sync Setup
Entry
Organizer initiates Auto Sync by texting:
Auto Sync


Auto Sync [Crew Name]



Crew Selection
Crew recognized
Crew is selected.


Proceed to event name.


Crew not recognized
“I couldn’t find that crew.
 Try again, text create crew to make a new one, or exit.”
No crews exist
“You don’t have any crews yet.
 Text create crew to get started.”

Event Name (Required)
Prompt:
“Event name?”
If empty:
“Please add an event name.”
Rules:
Event name is required.


Event name is shown in invitee messages and calendar invites.


Event name is never replaced by the crew name.


Duplicate event names are allowed.



Calendar Access (Optional)
If Google Calendar is connected, it is used automatically.


Auto Sync never prompts the organizer to connect a calendar.


If calendar is not connected, Auto Sync proceeds in no-calendar mode.


Calendar status is evaluated at Auto Sync start and applies only to that run.



Phase 2: Auto Sync Configuration
Step 1: Time Definition
With calendar connected
Organizer provides time windows in natural language.


Funlet evaluates calendar availability.


No-calendar mode
Organizer provides 1–3 concrete date/time options.


No recommendations are generated.


No conflict checking occurs.


If input is insufficient:
Ask a single clarifying question.


Organizer may exit at any time.
 Exiting discards Auto Sync entirely.

Step 2: Option Proposal (Calendar Mode Only)
One option shown at a time.


Week-level calendar visual (Monday–Sunday).


Calendar is read-only.


Proposed time is highlighted.


Primary message:
“Here’s a window that works.
 [Day], [Date] at [Time].
 Reply yes to save, suggest a change, or next to see another option.”
Rules:
Valid adjustments are accepted.


Conflicts are rejected.


Suggestions outside the shown week load the new week.


If no open windows:
“I couldn’t find a fully open window, but here’s the closest option.”
If calendar access fails:
“I’m having trouble accessing your calendar right now. Try again soon.”
 Auto Sync is discarded.

Step 3: Saving Options
Organizer may save 1–3 options.


Options are saved one at a time.


After saving:
“Saved.
 [Day], [Date] at [Time].
 Send Auto Sync, add another option, or exit?”
After 3rd option:
“Saved.
 You’ve added the maximum number of options.
 Reply send to start Auto Sync, or exit.”

Step 4: Response Goal
Prompt:
“What’s the response goal?
 Reply 1 for Everyone, 2 for Critical mass.”
Notes:
In v1, Everyone and Critical Mass behave identically.


The distinction is stored for future versions.



Step 5: Send Auto Sync Confirmation
Prompt:
“Ready to start Auto Sync?
 Reply send or exit.”
Accepted:
send


yes


y


If calendar is not connected and no time zone exists:
Prompt for time zone after send, before messages go out.


If user exits during time zone prompt:
Sending is canceled.


Auto Sync is discarded.



Phase 3: Auto Sync Execution
General Rules
Multiple Auto Syncs may run concurrently.


Each Auto Sync is independent.


Invitee replies bind to the most recent unresolved Auto Sync message.


Last reply always wins (Running or Paused).


No automatic decisions are made.



Invitee Availability Message (Required Header Locked)
Invitee SMS header is always:
“[Organizer name] is finding a time for [Event name].”
Example:
“Jon is finding a time for Dinner Catch-Up.”

Invitee Availability Message (Body)
“Which of these work for you?
Thu, Dec 12 at 7:00–9:00 PM PT


Fri, Dec 13 at 6:30 PM PT


Sun, Dec 15 at 5:00 PM PT
 Reply with the number(s) that work, or none if nothing works.”


Rules:
Extract all valid numbers.


Ignore all other text.


No follow-up questions.


No “Maybe” responses exist.


If no valid numbers:
“Reply with the number(s) that work for you, or none if nothing works.”
